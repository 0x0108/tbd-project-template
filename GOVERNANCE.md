## Contributors

Anyone may be an contributor to TBD projects. Contribution may take the form of:

* Asking and answering questions on the development forums
* Filing an issue
* Offering a feature or bug fix via a Pull Request
* Suggesting documentation improvements
* ...and more!

Anyone with a GitHub account may use the project issue trackers and communications channels. We welcome newcomers, so don't hesitate to say hi!

## Maintainers

Maintainers have write access GitHub repositories and act as project administrators. They approve and merge pull requests, cut releases, and guide collaboration with the community. They have:
The GitHub team for Node.js core collaborators is @nodejs/collaborators.
Collaborators have:

* Commit access to their project's repositories
* Write access to continuous integration (CI) jobs

Both maintainers and non-maintainers may propose changes to 
source code. The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request.
Maintainers review and merge (_land_) pull requests.

If a maintainer opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. The
exception is if the TSC votes to approve the change despite the opposition.
Usually, involving the TSC is unnecessary.

See:

* [List of maintainers - `MAINTAINERS.md`](./MAINTAINERS.md)
* [Contribution Guide - `CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Maintainer activities

* Helping users and novice contributors
* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* Participation in working groups
* Merging pull requests

## Technical Steering Committee

A subset of the collaborators forms the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).
The TSC has final authority over this project, including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of collaborators

The current list of TSC members is:

* Andrew Lee Rubinger, TBD Head of Open Source
* Angie Jones, TBD Head of Developer Relations
* Julie Kim, Block Lead of TBD Legal
* ...

The TSC is reached via (TODO) and is an available resource in mediation or for sensitive cases beyond the scope of project maintainers. It operates as a "Self-appointing council or board" as defined by Red Hat: [Open Source Governance Models](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-open-source-governance-models).
